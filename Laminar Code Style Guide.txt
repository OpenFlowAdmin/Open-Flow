General:

No public fields (always properties)
Only one (ish) level of indentation. If you implement more complexity, make it it’s own method
Avoid “else” (should be easier in conjunction with the last bullet point) (Sounds weird, ask me)
Data validation up front, (if null => throw exception) instead of (if not null => do stuff)


Class Ordering:
Ordering Members
Fields
Constructors
Delegates/Events
Properties
Methods
Enums
Nested Classes

Ordering modifiers
Const
Static
Readonly

Ordering Accessibility
Public
Internal
Protected
Private


Naming Conventions:
Methods, classes, events and properties use PascalCase
Method parameters use camelCase
Fields use _underscoreCamelCase
Anything static uses PascalCase
