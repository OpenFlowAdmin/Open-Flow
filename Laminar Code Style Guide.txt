General:
 - No public fields (always properties)
 - Only one (ish) level of indentation. If you implement more complexity, make it it’s own method
 - Avoid “else” (should be easier in conjunction with the last bullet point) (Sounds weird, ask me)
 - Data validation up front, (if null => throw exception) instead of (if not null => do stuff)


Class Ordering:
  - Ordering Members
    1. Fields
    2. Constructors
    3. Delegates/Events
    4. Properties
    5. Methods
    6. Enums
    7. Nested Classes

   - Ordering modifiers
    1. Const
    2. Static
    3. Readonly

  - Ordering Accessibility
    1. Public
    2. Internal
    3. Protected
    4. Private


Naming Conventions:
  - Methods, classes, events and properties use PascalCase
  - Method parameters use camelCase
  - Fields use _underscoreCamelCase
  - Anything static uses PascalCase
